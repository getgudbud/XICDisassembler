# XICDisassembler

Purpose: implement a disassembler for the SIC/XE instruction set architecture. The disassembler should be able to open an object code file, parse the records in the object code file, and output the corresponding assembly code to an assembly listing file. The assembly listing file format can be seen in the sample assembly listing file out.lst.
